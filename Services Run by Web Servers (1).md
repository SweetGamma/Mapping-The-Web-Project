**What to Do:**  
Describe what web servers do, including running scripts, serverless architectures, cloud computing, databases, and media. Give examples like how  cloud storage (eg., Google Drive) works.

**Main Questions needing to be answered.**  
How do browsers and web servers work together to run scripts?  
1\. Client (Browser) requests resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from the server. With this request it uses the HTTP Protocol.   
2\. Server responds with these resources (HTML documents, CSS files, JavaScript files, Images, videos, etc.) on top of the server being able to send headers that include metadata.  
3\. Browser loads and renders the HTML, executing inline JavaScript or requesting external JavaScript.   
4\. JavaScript runs on the client-side, allowing interactivity and dynamic page updates. Scripts are able to manipulate the content of the page, interact with the server, or perform other tasks like handling user inputs, modifying DOM (Document Object Model), and making AJAX requests. JavaScript is often asynchronous meaning that the browser can continue rendering the page while waiting for scripts or resources to load, improving performance.   
5\. Optionally, JavaScript communicates with the server for additional data or actions (e.g,. AJAX)

How do internet problems like slow speeds affect cloud-based services?  
1.File Transfers

- Uploading or downloading files takes longer. Syncing data (e.g., Google Drive might lag or fail. 

2\. Collaboration 

- Real-time tools (e.g., Google Docs) can lag or update slowly. Video calls and screen sharing may freeze or stutter. 

3\. Apps and Tools

- Cloud-based software (e.g., Adobe, Salesforce) may load slowly or crash. Web pages on cloud platforms might take forever to refresh.

4\. Streaming and Gaming

- Videos and games can buffer or drop to lower quality. Actions in cloud gaming may respond with a delay.

5\. Backups and Recovery

- Backing up files to the cloud takes more time. Restoring data during an emergency becomes slower. 

How do protocols like HTTP or HTTPS keep interactions with web servers secure?  
By encrypting the data so only the intended destination will receive it

How do IoT devices use web servers for real-time data?  
1.Collecting Data from Sensors

- IoT devices typically have sensors that collect data (e.g., temperature, motion, or humidity). This data is processed locally or sent directly to a web server.

2\. Sending Data to the Web Server

- IoT devices use protocols such as HTTP or MQTT to send collected data by using a Push model or a Pull Model. Push Model device actively sends data to the server at regular intervals, while with the Pull Model server requests data from the device when needed.

3\. Real-Time Data Processing

- Storing: Saving the data in a database for analysis or future use.  
- Processing: Applying algorithms to analyze or interpret the data  
- Triggering Actions: Initiating commands, alerts, or updates based on the data

4\. Providing Data to Users

- Dashboards: Web or mobile apps display live metrics, charts, or reports.  
- Notifications: Alerts or updates (e.g, text messages or push notifications)

5\. Remote Control and Management

- Uses can send commands to IoT devices via the web server, enabling remote control

**Additional Information**

- What is it?  
  	A web server is the main component that displays the content such as text, images, videos and applications, to users by storing, processing, and delivering webpages.

**Different Components of Web Servers.**

- Running Scripts

What it does: A set of instructions that the code follows

How it works: When activated  the code will follow the instructions doing what  the code says

- Serverless architectures

What it does:  It is a way of loading other applications or web pages using a cloud service which runs the code automatically.

How it works: you write a section of code that opens/loads something then the cloud loads it and manages the connection for you and only when it needs to

- Cloud Computing

What it does:  it runs apps over the internet and increases performance 

How it works: It uses the internet to process an app instead of using your computer's own hardware to run it, which will usually increase performance.

RLE: AWS

AWS stands for **Amazon Web Services**. It’s like a big toolbox in the cloud that businesses (and developers like you\!) can use to:

1. **Store files** (like Google Drive but more advanced).  
2. **Host websites** (think of it like renting space on the internet).  
3. **Run apps** (without needing your own expensive computer setup).

It’s important because **tons of websites and apps use AWS** to keep things running smoothly. Your teacher probably mentioned it because it’s a massive part of cloud computing—aka doing stuff online instead of on your computer.

- Databases

What it does:  It stores data values and keeps them for later use  
How it works: it keeps the info dormant until it is needed or requested.

**RLE:**

Databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and MongoDB, store and manage structured data for web applications.

They are used to store user accounts, content, product information, and more.

Web servers connect to databases to retrieve or update data dynamically.

- Media

What it does:  things like sounds, images, videos, etc, any files

How it works: it “fetches”  the media from storage and then displays it.
